## Project setup

```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration

The project needs to be configured with your Auth0 domain and client ID in order for the authentication flow to work.

To do this, first copy `auth_config.json.example` into a new file in the same folder called `auth_config.json`, and replace the values within with your own Auth0 application credentials:

```json
{
  "domain": "<YOUR AUTH0 DOMAIN>",
  "clientId": "<YOUR AUTH0 CLIENT ID>"
}
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```bash
npm run serve
```

## Deployment

### Compiles and minifies for production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Docker build

To build and run the Docker image, run `exec.sh`, or `exec.ps1` on Windows.

### Run your tests

```bash
npm run test
```

### Lints and fixes files

```bash
npm run lint
